abstract: >
  Telemachus Core is an open pivot format for B2B telematics data, designed to unify
  fragmented provider datasets (Geotab, Webfleet, Samsara, Teltonika) into a consistent,
  extensible schema. It supports GNSS, IMU, CAN, events, and context enrichments for
  both scientific research and fleet management applications.
