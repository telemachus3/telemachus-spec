# Introduction

## Context

Telematics data is essential for modern fleet management, vehicle tracking, and transportation analytics. However, the telematics ecosystem is highly fragmented, with numerous proprietary data formats and APIs that complicate data integration and interoperability. This fragmentation creates challenges for businesses and developers who need to aggregate and analyze telematics data from diverse sources.

## The Need for a Pivot Format

To address these challenges, there is a need for a standardized, open format that can serve as a common pivot point for telematics data exchange. Such a format would simplify integration, enable interoperability across different telematics providers, and foster innovation by reducing barriers to entry.

## Vision of Telemachus

Telemachus Core is designed as an open standard that provides a unified, extensible data model for telematics information. Inspired by the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) used in public transportation, Telemachus Core aims to create a similar ecosystem for telematics data. Alongside the open Core standard, Telemachus offers a business-oriented extension called Fleet Premium, which provides additional features and capabilities tailored to commercial fleet management needs. This dual approach balances openness with commercial viability, encouraging broad adoption while supporting advanced use cases.
