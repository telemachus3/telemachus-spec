# Introduction

## Context

Telematics data is essential for modern fleet management, vehicle tracking, and transportation analytics. However, the telematics ecosystem is highly fragmented, with numerous proprietary data formats and APIs that complicate data integration and interoperability. This fragmentation creates challenges for businesses and developers who need to aggregate and analyze telematics data from diverse sources.

## Challenges in the Current Landscape

The current telematics landscape faces several critical challenges that hinder its full potential:

- Fragmentation: The presence of many proprietary data formats and APIs leads to siloed data and complicates integration efforts.
- Lack of Standards: Without widely adopted standards, data consistency and quality vary significantly across providers.
- Provider Lock-in: Businesses often become dependent on specific telematics vendors, limiting flexibility and increasing costs.
- Limited Scientific Reproducibility: The absence of common data formats restricts the ability of researchers to reproduce and validate telematics studies effectively.

## The Need for a Pivot Format

To address these challenges, there is a need for a standardized, open format that can serve as a common pivot point for telematics data exchange. Such a format would simplify integration, enable interoperability across different telematics providers, and foster innovation by reducing barriers to entry. Practical benefits include:

- Enabling seamless interoperability between diverse telematics systems and platforms.
- Encouraging innovation by providing a common foundation for new tools, applications, and services.
- Enhancing transparency and data sharing among stakeholders, including researchers, developers, and fleet operators.

## Vision of Telemachus

Telemachus Core is designed as an open standard that provides a unified, extensible data model for telematics information. Inspired by the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) used in public transportation, Telemachus Core aims to create a similar ecosystem for telematics data. Alongside the open Core standard, Telemachus offers a business-oriented extension called Fleet Premium, which provides additional features and capabilities tailored to commercial fleet management needs. This dual approach balances openness with commercial viability, encouraging broad adoption while supporting advanced use cases.

## Benefits of Telemachus

Telemachus offers significant advantages for various stakeholders:

- Researchers: Facilitates reproducible studies by providing standardized, high-quality telematics datasets.
- Developers: Simplifies application development through a consistent and extensible data model.
- Fleet Operators: Enhances operational efficiency and decision-making with interoperable and comprehensive telematics insights.

## Conclusion

Telemachus aims to become the GTFS of the telematics world, bridging the gap between open science and commercial B2B needs. By establishing a common standard, it fosters collaboration, transparency, and innovation across the telematics ecosystem, ultimately driving better outcomes for all participants.
