## Comparative Overview of Existing Formats

| Feature / Format       | [GTFS](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs)                      | [DATEX II](https://datex2.eu/)                 | [NGSI-LD](https://www.etsi.org/standards/ngsi-ld)                  | [Flespi](https://flespi.io/)                   | [Otonomo / High Mobility](https://otonomo.io/)  |
|-----------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| Primary Use Case       | Public transit schedules  | Traffic and travel data  | Context information model| IoT data platform        | Automotive data exchange |
| Data Model            | Static and real-time transit data | Traffic management data | Linked data, semantic web | Telemetry and sensor data| Vehicle and mobility data|
| Standardization       | Open standard by Google   | European standard        | OMA SpecWorks standard    | Proprietary              | Proprietary              |
| Data Format           | CSV / JSON                | XML                      | JSON-LD                  | JSON                     | JSON                     |
| Real-time Support     | Yes                       | Yes                      | Yes                      | Yes                      | Yes                      |
| Semantic Interoperability | Limited               | Moderate                 | High                     | Limited                  | Moderate                 |
| Use in Industry       | Widely adopted in transit | Used by traffic agencies | Used in smart cities      | IoT and telematics       | Automotive OEMs and platforms|

## Conclusion

Telemachus aims to build upon the strengths of existing standards by providing a flexible, interoperable, and extensible framework tailored to the needs of modern telematics applications. By integrating semantic richness with real-time capabilities and broad industry applicability, Telemachus positions itself as a versatile solution bridging gaps left by current formats.
