# Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the planned evolution of the **Telemachus** project.

---

## Short-Term (0–3 months)

- ✅ Release **v0.1-alpha** with GNSS, Motion, IMU, Engine, Events, Context, Source.
- Expand documentation (State of the Art, Mappings, TCS, Contexts, Versioning, Glossary).
- Add more provider mappings (Geotab, Webfleet, Samsara, Teltonika).
- Deliver Python SDK (`telemachus-py`) with DataFrame + Parquet support.
- Deliver CLI tool (`telemachus-cli`) with validation and conversion commands.
- Publish example datasets (RS3 simulation, provider samples).
- Publish RS3 simulation datasets in Telemachus format (JSON/Parquet).
- Add "Getting Started" tutorials for SDK and CLI in the documentation.

---

## Medium-Term (3–12 months)

- Release **v0.2–v0.9** with incremental improvements.
- Add **Telemachus Completeness Score (TCS)** reference implementation.
- Expand **context modules**: altitude IGN, weather ERA5, road genome.
- Develop **bindings** for other languages (Java, JS/TS).
- Engage first adopters (researchers, SSII, mobility players).
- Publish **white paper** and present at industry/scientific conferences.
- Register DOI (Zenodo) for citation and adoption in academia.
- Provide official RS3 baseline dataset with TCS = 100% as reference.
- Publish benchmark comparing SaaS providers (Geotab, Webfleet, Samsara) vs RS3 baseline.
- Submit first scientific paper or extended abstract to an academic venue.

---

## Long-Term (12+ months)

- Release **v1.0 stable** with frozen Core spec.
- Define **Fleet Premium** extension: missions, SLA, KPIs.
- Promote adoption as an **open industry standard** (like GTFS).
- Integrate with ecosystem: insurance, fleet management, smart city.
- Build **community governance model** (open RFC process).
- Explore integration with **Otonomo/High Mobility/Flespi** and OEM APIs.
- Internationalization: documentation in FR/EN and wider community engagement.
- Formalize Road Genome context into a structured module (if adopted).
- Establish partnerships with standardization bodies (ISO, OGC, CEN).
- Provide certification or compliance badge for adopters.

## Conclusion

Telemachus will evolve from a **research-backed schema** into an **open industry standard** with both scientific credibility and business relevance.  
The staged roadmap ensures stability, adoption, and long-term sustainability.
